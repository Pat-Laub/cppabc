While writing the paper "[Approximate Bayesian Computation to fit and compare insurance loss models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03833)", I wrote this C++ experiment to decompound the sums of Geometric-Exponential random sums using ABC-SMC. This start shows some promise, but I don't currently have time to expand this to a more general package, like our [abcre](https://github.com/Pat-Laub/abcre) Python package. If someone would like to collaborate on this, let me know as I'd probably be keen to return to recommit to this idea after some motivation.
